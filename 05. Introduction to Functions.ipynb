    "A function is a way the programming language gives us to pack statements together, give a proper name to the transformation they produce together and define the input and output of such transformation.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can do a good guess on what it expects as input: **element** and **collection**. The names of the arguments can give us good clues of what the function expect them to be and what it will to with them. For instance, in this case we can gues that the **collection** is a container, probably a **list** or a **set** (it could be a dictionary, but then it would make more sense if the first parameter was named _key_ instead of _element_). We can then guess that **element** must be the thing that may be contained in the **collection**.\n",

    "## The Structure of a Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start writing functions, lets first look more in detail how to declare a function. It is actually quite simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start the line with `def`. This tells the Python interpreter that what comes next is the **definition** (`def` in short) of a function.\n",
    "* After `def` comes the **name** of the function. We will use the **name** to invoque the function from other parts of the program.\n",
    "* Next come the function **arguments**. They are a list of comma-separated names that we give to the inputs of the function, surrounded with parenthesis `()`.\n",
    "* We finish the signature definition of the function with a colon `:`. This indicates that we are ready to start writing the **body** of the function.\n",
    "* Finally, we arrive to the **body** of the function. Here we write all the statements that compose the function logic. We indicate Python that statements are part of the function by adding one level of indentation (spaces before the start of the line, usually 4) to them. We tell Python that we are done with the body of the function when we go back to writing statements with less indentation than the function body.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can indicate that the code execution for the function finishes at any point by writing `return`. `return` tells Python that the function has finished running and that it can **return** to the place in the code where it was called. In case we wish to pass a result back to the caller, we may add the value next to the `return`: `return 5`.\n",

    "In the case of `count` we check if `number` is `0` because we know that, for all positive numbers, if we keep substracting `1` eventually we'll arrive to `0` and the recursion will end. If, instead, the number used to call `count` is negative, it becomes an infinite recursion. Be careful when implementing recursive functions for these reasons."
